<h2>Economies Past</h2>

<p>The <strong>Economies Past</strong> website has been funded by a <strong>Higher Education Impact Fund</strong> grant (project leader: Leigh Shaw-Taylor) and an <strong>Economic and Social Research Council Impact Acceleration Account grant</strong> (project leaders: Leigh Shaw-Taylor and R.J. Davenport). The associated research project, <a href="https://www.campop.geog.cam.ac.uk/research/occupations/" target="_blank"><strong>the Occupational Structure of Britain c.1379-1911</strong></a><strong>,</strong> has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, the Leverhulme Trust, the British Academy and the Isaac Newton Trust (Cambridge). We would like to thank these bodies for their generous financial support.</p>

<p>The project is based at the <strong>Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure</strong>, in the <strong>Faculty of History</strong> and the <strong>Department of Geography</strong>, University of Cambridge.</p>

<p>The code for this project was originally created for the &#39;Atlas of Victorian Fertility Decline&#39; project (PI: A.M. Reid) with funding from the ESRC (ES/L015463/1) for their website documenting demographic change 1851-1911, <strong>populationspast.org.</strong> We would like to thank Dr Reid and the populationspast.org team for allowing us to &#39;piggy-back&#39; on their work and to acknowledge the ESRC for funding that project.</p>

<p>The team which created <strong>Economies Past</strong> was led by Dr Leigh Shaw-Taylor. Dr Xuesheng You prepared all the data for the site and created all the static maps. Martin Lucas-Smith, webmaster in the Department of Geography, who created the code for populationspast.org, wrote all the additional code required for <strong>Economies Past</strong>. Sophy Arulanantham was the project administrator and organised user-testing and feedback. All four contributed to the design of the site.</p>

<p>We would like to acknowledge the feedback and suggestions from our teacher liaison group: Claire Bishop, Jessica Duncan, Denise Eades and Kate Terry and from various members of the <strong>Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure</strong></p>

<h2>Occupational and Population Data</h2>

<p>The data displayed on the site have been produced by <a href="https://www.campop.geog.cam.ac.uk/research/occupations/" target="_blank"><strong>the Occupational Structure of Britain c.1379-1911</strong></a> project since 2003:</p>

	<li>For the period 1600-1800 male occupational data were produced by Dr Sebastian Keibek for his ESRC-funded Cambridge PhD thesis, <em>The male occupational structure of England and Wales, 1600-1850</em> (PhD dissertation, University of Cambridge, 2017). This used testamentary data provided by around 85 record offices around England and Wales, collected first by a team led by Shaw-Taylor on a Leverhulme Trust funded project (F/09 674/G) and then by Keibek. Keibek combined the testamentary with parish register data 1695-1820 collected by teams led Leigh Shaw-Taylor and E.A. Wrigley on two ESRC funded projects <a href="http://researchcatalogue.esrc.ac.uk/grants/RES-000-23-1579/read" target="_blank" title="undefined (Link to an external website)">(<span>RES-000-23-0131</span> and RES-000-23-1579</a>) and one Leverhulme Trust funded project (F/09 674/G). Dr Keibek developed a series of methodologies which allowed him to create representative high spatial resolution estimates of male occupational structure at ten year intervals over the period 1600-1800. We would like to thank all the county record offices of England and Wales, the National Archives, and the National Library of Wales, for making documents and data available to us.</li>
	<li>For the period 1851-1911, occupational data for males and females for both adults and children were abstracted by Dr Xuesheng You from an enhanced version of data from Sch&uuml;rer, K. and Higgs, E. (2014). <em>Integrated Census Microdata (I-CeM), 1851</em>-<em>1911</em>. [data collection]. Colchester, Essex: UK Data Archive [distributor]. SN: 7481, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-7481-1" target="_blank">http://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-7481-1</a>. We would like to thank Kevin Sch&uuml;rer and Eddy Higgs for creating this dataset and to acknowledge the role of the ESRC in funding the work.</li>
	<li>For 2011, male and female adult occupational data were abstracted from the 2011 population census by Dr Xuesheng You. Dr Joe Day undertook work which enabled these data to be mapped in the same spatial units as the data for the period 1600-1911. We would like to thank Dr Stephan Heblich, University of Bristol, for partly funding this work.</li>
	<li>All occupational data have been coded using the PST system of occupational classification developed by E.A. Wrigley and Ros Davies.</li>
	<li>Peter Kitson played a key role in managing the collection of the parish register occupational data and in standardising the data and transforming it into structured database.</li>
	<li>Gill Newton played a key role in creating database structures for the occupational and population datasets and in integrating these via the GIS boundary datasets.</li>
	<li>Data collection for parish registers 1695-1795: O. Dunn, J. Field and P.M. Kitson.</li>
	<li>Data collection for parish registers 1813-20: J. Barker, R. Churchley, O. Dunn, S. Hennesey, P.M. Kitson, J. Field, N. Modha, L. Monaghan-Pisano, G. Stanning, T. Swain,<br />

<h2>Boundary Data</h2>

<p>Three sets of historical boundary GIS datasets have been used on this site:</p>

<ul class="spaced">
	<li>Parish level boundary data were created for the <strong>Occupational Structure of Britain c.1379-1911</strong> project by a team led by Dr Max Satchell: Satchell, A.E.M., Kitson, P.M.K., Newton, G.H., Shaw-Taylor, L., and Wrigley E.A. (2017). <em>1851 England and Wales census parishes, townships and places</em>. [Data Collection]. Colchester, Essex: UK Data Archive. <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-852232" target="_blank">10.5255/UKDA-SN-852232</a>. The Satchell et al dataset is an enhanced version of Burton, N., Westwood J., and Carter P., <em>GIS of the ancient parishes of England and Wales, 1500-1850.</em> Colchester, Essex: UK Data Archive (May 2004), SN 4828 which is a GIS version of Kain, R.J.P., and Oliver, R.R., <em>Historic parishes of England and Wales: An electronic map of boundaries before 1850 with a gazetteer and metadata</em>. Colchester, Essex: UK Data Archive, May, 2001. SN 4348. This parish boundary dataset was simplified somewhat by Dr Xuesheng You to create a boundary dataset that could be used to map the data over the whole period 1600-2011 at high spatial resolution in consistent spatial units. We would like to thank the Economic and Social Research Council (RES-000-23-1579 and the Impact Acceleration Account grant), the Leverhulme Trust, and the British Academy for funding this work.</li>
	<li>Registration sub-district boundaries were created by Dr Joe Day for the &#39;Atlas of Victorian Fertility Decline&#39; project (PI: A.M. Reid) with funding from the ESRC (ES/L015463/1): Day, J.D. Registration sub-district boundaries for England and Wales 1851-1911 (2016). This dataset was created from: Satchell, A.E.M., Kitson, P.M.K., Newton, G.H., Shaw-Taylor, L., and Wrigley E.A. (2017). <em>1851 England and Wales census parishes, townships and places.</em> [Data Collection]. Colchester, Essex: UK Data Archive. <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-852232" target="_blank">10.5255/UKDA-SN-852232</a> The Satchell et al dataset is an enhanced version of Burton, N., Westwood J., and Carter P., <em>GIS of the ancient parishes of England and Wales, 1500-1850.</em> Colchester, Essex: UK Data Archive (May 2004), SN 4828 which is a GIS version of Kain, R.J.P., and Oliver, R.R., <em>Historic parishes of England and Wales: An electronic map of boundaries before 1850 with a gazetteer and metadata</em>. Colchester, Essex: UK Data Archive, May, 2001. SN 4348. This work was funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC ES/L015463/1).</li>
	<li>The county boundaries shown on the interactive and PDF maps are for the historic counties of England and Wales c. 1851. They were created for the project by Dr Max Satchell: Satchell, M. and Shaw-Taylor, L.M.W. and Wrigley, E.A. and Kitson, P.K. and Newton, G.H. (2018). <em>1851 England and Wales ancient counties.</em> [Data Collection]. Colchester, Essex: UK Data Archive. <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.5255/UKDA-SN-852942" target="_blank">10.5255/UKDA-SN-852942</a> We would like to thank the Economic and Social Research Council (RES-000-23-1579), The Leverhulme Trust (F/09 674/G), and the British Academy for funding this work.</li>
